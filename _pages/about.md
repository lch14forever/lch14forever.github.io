I am a postdoc at the Xavier Lab, affiliated with the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute. I obtained my Ph.D. from the National University of Singapore (associated with the Genome Institute of Singapore) under the guidance of Dr. Niranjan Nagarajan and Prof. Limsoon Wong. 

Throughout my training in computational biology, I have gained experience with various types of data generated mainly with high-throughput sequencing. I have worked on diverse biological problems ranging from decoding the genetics of bacteria and human to model the ecological relationship of microbial communities.

My current research interest revolves around unravelling the "dark matter" of gut bacteria, exploring their significant metabolic capacity that remains poorly understood. Simultaneously, I am actively engaged in projects focused on characterizing the transcriptomic landscape of the intestine in response to perturbations.
